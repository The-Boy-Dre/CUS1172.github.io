    University: St Johns University, Queens Campus
    Degree: Bachelors of Science in Computer Science Computer Security Systems
    
    Throughout my four years at St Johns University I've learned a lot of topics regarding 
    my major but unfortunately a lot of what i've learnt was completely useless due to the
    insane amount of elective courses required to complete the degree, they say that it's suppose
    to make a student more well rounded, but in reality it's just a convenient excuses to keep 
    students in higher education as long as possible. Especially when your a determined student that has
    a passion for learning about computer related topics, the elective courses tend to forcibly 
    draw your attention away from your main interests and forces you to be distracted with irrelevant topics
    that most likely won't benefit your work life in any forseeable way. A matter of fact, because of the two 
    years worth of required electives we as students had to spend extra hours during our free time to studying 
    various topics that the university doesn't teach until we undertake a majority of our core classes 
    upon completing the electives around 4-5 semesters after enrollment. Overall a majority of my college 
    experience was just wasted time doing courses that were religious or miscellaneous based that fell 
    extremely short of the greatest teach a student cna ask for, the internet.
